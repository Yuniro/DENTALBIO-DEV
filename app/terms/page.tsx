            </h1>

            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">Terms last updated: 23rd September 2024</p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio is a platform designed to help dental professionals create and manage online profiles, offering a centralised hub where users can share relevant content and links. We aim to keep things straightforward, so these terms and conditions ("Terms") explain how you can use Dentalbio and its related services.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Welcome to Dentalbio!</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              We are delighted that you’ve chosen to use Dentalbio. These Terms, alongside our associated policies, govern your use of the services provided via our website (https://dental.bio), apps, and associated tools or features (collectively, the "Platform" or "Dentalbio"). By using Dentalbio, you agree to comply with these Terms as well as any additional policies linked within the Platform.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              When we refer to "we," "our," or "us," we mean Biocloud Ltd (company number: 15869715, registered at 113 Crawford Street, London, W1H 2JG), the legal entity that owns Dentalbio. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, please refrain from using Dentalbio. We recommend you carefully read through these Terms, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us at support@dental.bio.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio may evolve over time as we enhance our services and add new features. Occasionally, we may need to update these Terms to reflect platform changes, legal updates, or other business reasons. When we make changes, we will post the revised Terms on our Platform, and it is your responsibility to review them periodically.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If a significant change is made that could negatively impact your use of Dentalbio, we will try to notify you at least 30 days in advance, typically through an in-platform notification. Your continued use of the Platform following any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree with the updated Terms, we advise you to discontinue using Dentalbio and close your account.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Creating an Account</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              To use Dentalbio, you must create an account. You must be at least 18 years old to register for an account, and by doing so, you confirm that you have the legal capacity to agree to these Terms. If you are creating an account on behalf of a business or another individual, you confirm that you are authorised to bind them to these Terms.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              You agree to provide accurate and current information when creating your account and to keep this information up to date. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account details, including your password, and for any actions taken using your account. If you suspect unauthorised use of your account, please notify us immediately at support@dental.bio.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Your account is personal to you, and you may not transfer or assign it to another person without our prior written consent. Misuse of your account that damages our reputation or violates any laws may result in suspension or termination of your access to the Platform.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Choosing a Username</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              When creating your Dentalbio profile, you will select a username. It is important that this username respects the rights of others and is not offensive or misleading. You must avoid using names that belong to another person or entity (such as celebrities or brands) or choosing a username with the intention of reselling it (commonly referred to as "cybersquatting").
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If we believe your username violates these guidelines or infringes on another's rights, we may ask you to choose a new one or, in certain cases, reassign it. If you do not comply, we may suspend or terminate your account. If a third party claims that your username infringes their intellectual property (IP) rights, you will have the opportunity to respond to their claims in accordance with applicable IP laws.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If your account remains inactive for six months or more, we reserve the right to reclaim or reassign your username. Before taking this action, we will try to contact you using the information linked to your account.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Managing Your Plan</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio offers both free and paid subscription plans. Your subscription begins when you accept these Terms and continues until you cancel it. You can cancel your paid plan at any time, and unless otherwise required by law, payments are non-refundable. If you cancel, your account will revert to the free plan at the end of your current billing cycle.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If you purchased your subscription through a third-party service like Apple’s App Store or Google Play, you must cancel your subscription directly through that service. Dentalbio cannot process refunds for purchases made through external platforms. You may also request a refund from the applicable service provider by following their guidelines.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If you decide to permanently delete your account, you can do so from your account settings. Please note that once your account is deleted, you will lose access to any content or information associated with it, and this action is irreversible.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Your Content</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio allows you to post a variety of content, including links, text, videos, and other materials. By uploading content to your profile, you represent that:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <li>You either own the content or have the necessary permissions to post it;</li>
              <li>Your content does not violate anyone’s privacy, intellectual property, or other rights;</li>
              <li>Your content is accurate, not misleading, and complies with all applicable laws and our Community Guidelines;</li>
              <li>Your content does not contain viruses, harmful code, or disruptive elements that could harm the Platform or other users;</li>
              <li>You will not use the Platform to post unsolicited advertisements or promotional materials;</li>
              <li>Your content aligns with our community standards and policies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these Terms or applicable laws. In certain cases, we may restrict access to your profile or apply a sensitive content warning if we deem your content inappropriate for all audiences.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">7. What We Can Do with Your Content</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              By posting content on your Dentalbio profile, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive licence to use, display, distribute, modify, and adapt your content. This licence allows us to feature your content across the Platform, and in our marketing and promotional activities, both on Dentalbio and other media channels.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              You retain ownership of all rights to your content, but by posting it on Dentalbio, you agree that:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <li>We may use your content in connection with our business operations;</li>
              <li>We are not required to pay you or any third parties for using your content;</li>
              <li>Your content may be publicly accessible, and other users or third parties may share or reuse it, including beyond Dentalbio;</li>
              <li>We may modify or remove your content if it violates these Terms, our Community Guidelines, or applicable laws.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">8. Monetising Your Content</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio offers monetisation features that allow users to generate income through their profiles. If you are eligible for any monetisation programme, we will notify you via email or through your profile dashboard.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Here are the key requirements and conditions for accessing monetisation features:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <li>Eligibility: You must reside in a country where monetisation features are available, and you must have verified your email address. If you move to a country where monetisation is not available, your access to these features may be revoked.</li>
              <li>Account Standing: To maintain access to monetisation, your account must comply with these Terms and our Community Guidelines. Any violations could result in the suspension or removal of monetisation privileges.</li>
              <li>Commission: Dentalbio may negotiate commission rates for affiliate sales or transactions conducted through the Platform. These rates will be displayed in your account dashboard and are subject to change at our discretion.</li>
              <li>Transparency: You are legally required to disclose any commissions, partnerships, or sponsorships in your profile content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio is not responsible for any third-party commissions or transactions conducted through external affiliate networks or payment providers. You are responsible for managing these relationships independently.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">9. Payouts for Monetisation</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If you participate in Dentalbio’s monetisation features, you will receive monthly payouts for eligible funds earned through commission-based transactions. These payouts will be made via third-party payment processors such as PayPal or Stripe. You are required to complete any necessary "Know Your Customer" (KYC) processes to receive funds through these platforms.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio will only pay out "closed commissions," which means transactions that are final and irreversible. Pending commissions that have not been finalised may not be paid out. In the event of account termination, you will receive payouts for closed commissions up to the date of termination, but pending commissions may be forfeited.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Please be aware that fees, taxes, and other external charges may apply to your transactions, and you are responsible for ensuring compliance with your local tax obligations. Dentalbio is not responsible for any withholding taxes, income taxes, or other financial obligations arising from your use of the Platform.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">10. Suspension or Termination of Your Account</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If you breach these Terms, fail to comply with our Community Guidelines, or violate any applicable laws, Dentalbio reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account. Depending on the nature and severity of the breach, we may take action including, but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <li>Temporary suspension of your account;</li>
              <li>Removal of specific content from your profile;</li>
              <li>Limitation or removal of access to monetisation features;</li>
              <li>Permanent termination of your account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              We will endeavour to notify you before taking any action, although this is not always possible. If your account is terminated, you will lose access to any content or features associated with it, and any pending monetisation payouts may be forfeited. You will not receive a refund for any payments made before the termination of your account.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If you believe your account has been wrongfully suspended or terminated, you may contact us at support@dental.bio. We are committed to resolving disputes in good faith, and we encourage open communication before pursuing legal action. Both parties agree to make reasonable efforts to resolve any disputes for at least 30 days before considering litigation.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">11. Your Responsibility for End Users</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              As a Dentalbio user, you are solely responsible for your profile visitors and any customers who engage with your content or purchase goods or services through your profile (collectively referred to as "End Users"). You are responsible for:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <li>Ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding transactions and interactions with End Users;</li>
              <li>Providing accurate, clear, and honest information about the goods or services you offer;</li>
              <li>Managing disputes, refunds, and any issues that arise from transactions with End Users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio is not responsible for any products or services sold through your profile, nor are we responsible for any donations collected via features like the "Support Me" option. Donations must be voluntary and cannot be used as a substitute for selling goods or services unless clearly stated.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">12. Feedback and Beta Features</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              We appreciate any feedback you provide to help improve Dentalbio. From time to time, we may offer you access to beta features or experimental tools to test new functionality. By providing feedback or using beta features, you agree that we can use your suggestions or insights without compensating you.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Beta features are in development, so they may not be fully functional or reliable. Your use of these features is at your own risk, and we may discontinue or modify them at any time.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">13. Fees and Payments</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If you opt for a paid plan on Dentalbio, you agree to the applicable subscription fees and any related charges. Fees are generally displayed in GBP (British Pounds) and include taxes such as VAT, unless specified otherwise. Your subscription will start when you accept these Terms and will be billed in advance, either monthly or annually, depending on the plan you choose.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Subscription Renewal:</strong> Your paid plan will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel it before the renewal date. Upon renewal, the updated fees and Terms will apply.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Payment Methods:</strong> You must provide valid payment information, such as a credit or debit card, when signing up for a paid plan. By doing so, you authorise us to charge the applicable fees to your chosen payment method. If a payment fails, you will receive a notice to resolve the issue within a specified period to avoid a disruption in your service.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Transaction Fees:</strong> Certain features on Dentalbio, such as monetisation tools, may include transaction fees. These are percentage-based and will be deducted from the transaction amount before funds are credited to your account. These fees are dependent on your subscription plan and are detailed on our pricing page. Transaction fees are in addition to any external fees charged by third-party payment processors like Stripe or PayPal.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>External Fees:</strong> Payment processing services may impose additional fees for transactions, which will be deducted before you receive payment. Dentalbio is not responsible for these external fees, and it is your responsibility to review and accept the terms and fees imposed by third-party payment processors.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Fee Changes:</strong> Dentalbio reserves the right to change its subscription or transaction fees. We will notify you at least one month before any fee changes take effect. If you do not agree with the new fees, you have the option to cancel your plan before the next billing cycle begins.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">14. Taxes and Compliance</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              As a Dentalbio user, you are responsible for complying with all applicable tax obligations in your country. This includes any taxes related to your earnings through the Platform, such as income taxes or VAT. You must ensure that you fulfil any reporting or tax filing requirements imposed by your local authorities. Dentalbio is not responsible for withholding or paying taxes on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If you fail to meet your legal tax obligations, Dentalbio will not be held liable for any penalties or losses you incur.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">15. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">

            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio may offer features or integrations with third-party services, such as payment processing through Stripe or PayPal. These services are subject to their own terms and conditions, which you are responsible for reviewing and complying with. Dentalbio does not control or endorse any third-party services and is not responsible for any issues arising from your use of them.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If we display third-party terms or agreements, they will be available on the Platform, and your continued use of those services implies acceptance of their terms.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">21. App Terms</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If you download and use the Dentalbio app on a mobile or tablet device, the following terms apply:
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Licence to Use:</strong> You are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to download and install the app on a single device that you own or control. The app is for your personal use only and should not be distributed or made available over a network where it can be accessed by multiple devices at once.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Updates:</strong> From time to time, we may release updates or new versions of the app. By using the app, you agree that these Terms will also apply to any updates or changes. If you do not agree with any changes, you should uninstall the app and discontinue its use.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Cancellation and Deletion:</strong> If you or we cancel your account, you must delete the app from your device. Continued use of the app after cancellation may result in further actions, including data deletion or suspension of access.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>App Store Terms:</strong> If you download the app from a third-party store, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play, you also agree to comply with their specific terms of service. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the App Store terms, the App Store terms will prevail.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              We are solely responsible for providing the app and its content. If you have complaints or experience technical issues, contact us at support@dental.bio, not the App Store.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              You confirm that you are not on a US government restricted parties list or living in a country subject to US embargoes or sanctions.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> The App Store providers and their subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and have the right to enforce these Terms against you as applicable.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">22. Open Source Software</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              The Dentalbio app may include components of open-source software, which are governed by their own specific licence terms. These licences may grant you rights beyond those provided under these Terms. If any open-source licence conflicts with these Terms, the terms of the open-source licence will apply solely to the specific component involved.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              For a full list of the open-source components used within the app and their licence terms, visit our Open-Source Content Library on the legal section of the Dentalbio app or website.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">23. Termination and Suspension of Service</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentalbio reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account or access to the Platform at any time for breach of these Terms, failure to comply with legal obligations, or for any other reason we deem necessary to protect our business, users, or the integrity of the Platform.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              In the event of termination:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <li>You will no longer have access to your account, and all content associated with your profile may be deleted.</li>
              <li>Any outstanding subscription fees are non-refundable unless required by law.</li>
              <li>Dentalbio will not be liable for any data loss or service disruption resulting from account termination.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If you wish to terminate your own account, you can do so by contacting support@dental.bio. Upon termination, these Terms will cease to apply, except for any provisions that should survive termination (such as provisions related to intellectual property, liability, and indemnity).
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">24. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              These Terms and any disputes arising out of or related to your use of Dentalbio will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. Both you and we agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms or the use of the Platform.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the Terms will continue to apply in full force and effect.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">25. Final Provisions</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, along with our Privacy Policy and any other legal documents referenced within the Platform, constitute the entire agreement between you and Dentalbio. They supersede any prior agreements or understandings regarding your use of the Platform.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>No Waiver:</strong> Our decision not to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights or provisions.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Severability:</strong> If any part of these Terms is deemed unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be removed, and the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Transfer of Rights:</strong> You may not transfer or assign your rights under these Terms to anyone else without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer our rights to a third party without your consent as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Notices:</strong> We may provide notices to you by email or through the Platform. You are responsible for ensuring that we have an up-to-date email address for you. Any notices provided by us will be deemed effective as of the date of delivery.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
              <strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Dentalbio will not be held liable for any delay or failure in performance caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, war, strikes, labour disputes, government action, or failures in telecommunications or other technology services.
            </p>
